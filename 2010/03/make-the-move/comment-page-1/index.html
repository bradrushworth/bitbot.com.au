                    <p class="post-details">Posted on 26. Mar, 2010 by <a href="https://www.bitbot.com.au/author/brad/" title="Posts by Brad Rushworth" rel="author">Brad Rushworth</a> in <a href="https://www.bitbot.com.au/topics/articles/open-source/" rel="category tag">Open-Source</a></p>
                    
                    <p>BitBot Software uses Linux and many other FOSS software packages daily. In fact, we have made it our whole business. I encourage you to consider what Open-Source Software can do for you and your business.</p>
<h3 id="foss">What is FOSS?</h3>
<p>FOSS stands for ‘Free and Open Source Software’. ‘Free’ in this context refers to ‘freedom’ (as in free speech), not  price (although FOSS also tends to be).</p>
<h3 id="linux">What is Linux?</h3>
<p>Linux is an operating system for your computer, in a similar way that  Microsoft Windows and Apple’s OSX are operating systems for your  computer. Linux is stable, extremely flexible and well supported. It is the  fastest growing operating system in the world and it is freely available  for <em>you</em> to install onto your computer! Sound great? It is!</p>
<h3 id="why">Why should I move to Linux?</h3>
<p>Ok, so your installation of Windows ‘works fine’ so why should you  bother about Linux? Good question.</p>
<h4 id="viruses">Viruses and Spyware</h4>
<p>Linux does not suffer from virus and spyware problems like Windows does.  This is because of the secure way Linux was designed. Imagine not  having to worry about getting a virus or opening that email attachment!  Feel confident when using your computer.</p>
<h4 id="security">Security and Stability</h4>
<p>Linux is designed to be stable, safe and secure. Due to the nature of  open source software, any security flaws are fixed very quickly. The  world’s best programmers and thousands of people contribute to the  programs you would use everyday and this means you get the best software  packages available which are continually being improved. Using Linux puts you  in control of your computer and you can rest knowing your system is  safe, secure, and the software will always exist. Security updates are  always available and you don’t have to worry about issues like Microsoft  no-longer supporting your version of Windows and having to pay for an  upgrade (and probably a new computer!).</p>
<h4 id="package">Package Management</h4>
<p>You can search for and install software on your Linux computer in a  single convenient application. No searching the internet for the files  you need or fumbling through the latest CD you got in the mail, just hit  the install button to watch Linux download the required files from the  internet and install them for you. Not only this, but once you have your  system and applications installed, Linux keeps track of all of the  application updates automatically, regardless of whether you have used  those applications before or even knew that they were installed! So  whether it’s a security update, a new version of OpenOffice.org, or even  the core Linux system itself, it is all handled seamlessly and easily.  And, most importantly, being open source you know you can trust the  software that is being installed!</p>
<h4 id="features">Features</h4>
<p>Linux is often at the forefront of computer technology and innovation.  It is not bound by the same pressures as commercial entities and people  are free to be creative and innovative. Some examples of where Linux has  already included features before Windows are: fancy 3D desktop effects  with <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fXgl" target="_blank">Xgl</a> and <a href="http://beryl-project.org/" target="_blank">beryl</a>; TV and media  centre with <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/" target="_blank">mythtv</a>;  desktop searching with <a href="http://www.beagle-project.org/" target="_blank">beagle</a>; desktop widgets with <a href="http://netdragon.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">superkaramba</a>;  and many more. Plus, Linux is available for free right now!</p>
<h4>Compatibility</h4>
<p>Linux runs on anything. In fact it is the most widely supported  operating system in the world! From brand new computers to old ones you  were going to throw away there is always a Linux version for you. With  Linux you can still browse websites all over the internet, watch movies,  listen to your music, access your digital camera, use your scanner and  much much more. You can also send emails and create documents that are  compatible with Windows systems.</p>
<h4 id="freedom">Free (as in freedom)</h4>
<p>Linux is free open source software. This might not mean much to you if  you are not a programmer, but even if you are just an end user, it means  you can <em>trust</em> the software). Free open source software is also gaining popularity all  over the world and is on the rise. Now is a good time to start learning a  valuable new skill set.</p>
<h4 id="foc">Free (as in price)</h4>
<p>You might think that your computer came with Windows for free, but you  actually <em>did</em> pay for it. Linux  however, actually <em>is</em> free. Forget worrying about pirated  software! From complete office suites to media programs and internet  applications, the open source software that comes with Linux is not only  fully featured, it doesn’t cost a cent.</p>
<h4 id="easy">Easy and Intuitive</h4>
<p>A single 20 minute install of Linux will set up all your software <em>and</em> all your hardware in one go! You don’t need to waste time searching for  driver disks and going through the frustration of installing all your  software. Once your Linux system is installed you will find it is very  simple and easy to use. Linux is continually being improved and made  more intuitive because people have the freedom to make changes to the  software. These are then made available for everyone else to benefit  from.</p>
<h4 id="choice">Choice and Control</h4>
<p>Linux also puts you in control by giving you choice. Choice about what  software to run and how you run it. You don’t have to worry about being  stuck with one particular program or a set way of doing something. There  are thousands of free computer programs available for you to install at  the click of a button! Indeed you can even customise the interface to  your liking, or choose one of the various Linux versions available that  work differently out of the box. Linux is flexible and lets you create a  system that works for you. Find or create something that suits you!</p>
<h4 id="community">Community</h4>
<p>Everyone using Linux does so because they <em>chose</em> to, not because  they had to. People develop Linux because they have a passion for it,  not because they do it for money or market share. This means things are  done for the <em>right</em> reasons. Users are always willing to help  others and Linux is a global collaboration effort. The Linux community  is made up of people just like you and it’s a great community to be a  part of.</p>
<h4 id="fun">Fun!</h4>
<p>Linux is also FUN to use. Imagine actually enjoying using your computer  again! There’s just something great about running Linux on your  computer, even computer savvy people will be impressed!</p>
<h3 id="data">What about my data?</h3>
<p>One of the major hurdles when converting from closed source software is  compatibility. Companies which create their own closed source formats  make it virtually impossible for anyone else to know how their formats  work. Despite this, Linux is compatible with almost every data format in  existence and there is generally a freely available program that will  read your data. For example, Microsoft Office documents are supported in  the <a href="http://openoffice.org/" target="_blank">OpenOffice.org</a> suite and Adobe Photoshop files are supported in the <a href="http://gimp.org/" target="_blank">Gimp</a>.</p>
<p>Organisations all around the world, including the National Archives of  Australia, are switching their documents to this new format to ensure  unrestricted access to digital information now and in the future. We  encourage users to switch from using closed and dangerous proprietary  formats to open and freely available formats, which will be around  forever.</p>
<h3 id="considerations">Other considerations</h3>
<p>It is likely that much of your existing Windows software will not run on  Linux natively. However, there are ways to provide a compatibility layer for  Linux to allow you to run Windows software.</p>
<p>Most computer games will not run natively under Linux. There are a few however, like the Unreal Tournament and Quake series of  games, which already run perfectly under Linux.</p>
<p>Essentially, the file format for Microsoft Office documents is closed  source and proprietary. Although Word and Excel files are the  pseudo-standard in many business contexts, it is important to understand  that the way in which the Microsoft Office suite of applications store  your data on your computer’s hard drive is not a standard. Fortunately, there are a number of excellent Linux applications which  are great replacements for all of Microsoft Office’s functionality. Even  better, some programs like the <a href="http://openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> suite can even read and write Microsoft Office files.</p>
<p>Linux supports more hardware devices out of the box than any other  operating system, however there is a range of devices that do not work  easily. Most of these are what is called ‘win-hardware’. These devices  have a software component which needs to be installed on Windows in  order for them work. As Linux does not run Windows software these  devices are often hard to configure. Example devices include some  wireless cards, some printers, and some internal dialup modems. In many  cases the open source community has written their own Linux drivers for  these devices, however in some cases the manufacturer may not release  sufficient information to make this possible. Fortunately more and more  manufacturers are supporting Linux, so hopefully this issue will soon be  in the past.</p>
<h3 id="computer">Will Linux run on your computer?</h3>
<p>As Linux has excellent hardware support, chances are that the Linux  distribution you choose will run well on your computer.</p>
<h3 id="getstarted">Get started!</h3>
<p>BitBot Software recommends <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Linux</a> for most casual computer  users.</p>
